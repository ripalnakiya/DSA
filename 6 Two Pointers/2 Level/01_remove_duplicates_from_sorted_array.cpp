$ LeetCode: 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.
After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order.
The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.

$ Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

$ Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
